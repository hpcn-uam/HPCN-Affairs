=== LaTeX packages ===

- _hpman.cls_: Document class based on memoir for technical manuals.
- _hpcn_: Beamer theme. With _\usetheme[naudit]{hpcn}_ changes to Naudit theming.

The _install_ script is provided: it moves automatically _.cls_ and _.sty_ files to the LaTeX installation in your system. This way, you don't have to copy to every directory where you want to use them,.
